# NSMB-MarioVsLuigi
A unity-standalone 2-10 player remake of the Mario vs Luigi gamemode from the New Super Mario Bros DS download game. 

Includes the 5 default levels (Grassland, Bricks, Castle, Pipes, and Ice), along with custom levels: Jungle, Sky, and Volcano! 
All powerups are implemented and fully faithful to their originals, along with the addition of NSMBWii's Propeller Suit & Ice Flower!
