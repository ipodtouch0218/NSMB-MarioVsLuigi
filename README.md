# Mario Vs Luigi - Mobile Port

An adaptation of [MarioVsLuigi](https://github.com/ipodtouch0218/NSMB-MarioVsLuigi) for mobile phones. This port is a 1:1 adaptation of MvsL for smartphones, i've only changed things that don't give an advantage over other non-mobile players while also making a better experience for the mobile users.

## Main features
- Being able to connect to the official lobbies.
- Touch screen adapted controls.
- Compatible from Android 5.1 to Android 14
- Fixing the lobby chat.
- The ability to disable touch controls at will.

## Planed features for future updates
- Beeing able to make Mobile-version-only lobbies.

## Features I won't add 
This section recopiles the most asked features for the android port that are
either not possible right now, pointless or not as good of an idea as they seem.

- **D-Pad**: Although the d-pad is the predilected way to play 2d platformers, it sucks at that if it's on a touchscreen, wher your finguers cannot distinguish the sides, that's why i won't add the d-pad.

- **Movable/resizeable controls**: If im beeing honest, i don't really want to go through the pain that seems to be doing that just at first glance.

## Other Work In progress projects
- NSMBW, NSMB2 & NSMBUD Styles.
- Singleplayer/cooperative mode with completly new levels and remixes of old ones.
