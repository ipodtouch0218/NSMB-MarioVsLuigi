Version 5.1.5 (24. April 2025 - rev7920)
    Fixed: Bug in QueueIncomingCommand() which allowed duplicates of commands being queued. This affected fragment reassembly, leading to exceptions and disconnects. This bug has been in v5.1.3 and v5.1.4.
    
Version 5.1.4 (10. April 2025 - rev7900)
    Changed: WebSocket implementation for Unity WebGL/JS. It is compatible with Unity 6, Emscripten 2023 and C/C++ Threading support. This makes the WebSocket.jslib require Unity 2021.3.x or newer. Mail us to get support for older Unity versions if necessary.
    Removed: Internally outdated call of OnConnect() from the WebGL SocketWebTcp implementation.
    Changed: Internally used classes from namespace Photon.Client.Security are moved to Photon.Client.Encryption.
    Fixed: Handling of unsequenced reliable commands in QueueIncomingCommand().

Version 5.1.3 (06. March 2025 - rev7864)
    Changed: WebSocket implementation for Unity WebGL/JS exports and WebSocket-sharp based implementation (in PhotonLibs\WebSocket\).
    Note: The goal is to process incoming messages in WebGL (and with WebSocket-sharp) more directly. This specifically helps the Voice SDK on WebGL to process the stream while in background.
    Changed: WebSocketTcp and WebSocket to receive incoming messages via callbacks. At the same time our WebSocket code now also implements all typical callbacks for WS/WSS.
    Changed: WebSocket.jslib replicates "standard" JS websocket methods and callbacks in its interface instead of caching messages for polling.
    Changed: PreserveAttribute in SupportClass.cs is now public, so it can be used in WebSocket code as needs be.

Version 5.1.2 (19. November 2024 - rev7770)
	Fixed: Some allocations that can be avoided. For example the EventData.Sender is no longer allocating anything, if the Sender of an event was not set (it is considered ActorNumber 0).

Version 5.1.1 (22. Oktober 2024 - rev7739)
    Changed: Internal TryParseAddress method, which failed for URLs without a port. This did not work well with the Realtime API's AddressRewriter and URLs for Discord Activities (which typically use a scheme but not a port).

Version 5.1.0 (01. Oktober 2024 - rev7714)
	Added: Folders "debug" and "release" in "PhotonLibs\netstandard2.0\" for Unity SDKs. There are compile constraints on the dlls to make "debug" the default. Define "PHOTON_LIBS_RELEASE" for your project to select the release dlls.
	Note: The difference between debug and release dlls is minimal. Performance may be a bit better in the release builds. The feature "Network Simulation" is only available in the debug builds to prevent accidental release with it.
	Changed: Release build of dll can now capture the traffic.
    Internal: Removed NETFX_CORE compile defines mostly.
	Updated: WebSocket for WebGL exports (WebSocket\WebSocket.jslib) to support Unity's (experimental) option to "Enable Native C/C++ Multithreading".
	Added: Debugger attributes to improve debug view for classes ParameterDictionary, NonAllocDictionary and Node.

Version 5.0.11 (28. August 2024 - rev7655)
    No notable changes.

Version 5.0.10 (10 July 2024 - rev7627)
    Fixed: SendAcksOnly() for TCP and WS/WSS. It now sends a ping immediately to actually keep the connection up if SendOutgoingCommands() is not called for longer (e.g. when PUN IsMessageQueueRunning is false).
    Note: The above issue was introduced 8. May 2024, rev7552. So v5.0.8. and v5.0.9 would time out for TCP or WebSockets, if SendOutgoingCommands() was paused longer.
    Internal: TPeer.SendPing() to have an optional parameter to send the ping immediately. This allows SendAcksOnly to send it without sending anything queued.
    Internal: TPeer.Reset() to also update lastPingActivity.

Version 5.0.9 (26. June 2024 - rev7603)
    Fixed: De/serialization when using struct-based Custom Types (e.g. Fusion's NetworkId).
    Renamed: TrafficStatsSnapshot.SnapshotTimeStamp to SnapshotTimestamp with lowercase "stamp". Obsolete version is in place to avoid renaming trouble.

Version 5.0.8 (27. May 2024 - rev7574)
    No notable changes.

Version 5.0.7 (16. May 2024 - rev7565)
    Changed: TPeer.SendPing() will now enqueue the message instead of sending it immmediately. This makes sure a ping is never sent as first message (which has to be an Init).
    Changed: To re-using a ParameterDictionary for pinging in WS / WSS.
    Internal: Removed support for Native Datagram Encryptor v1. Removed related NATIVE_ENCRYPTOR_API1 define.
    Changed: InitDatagramEncryption() now has one obsolete variant. Randomizing sequence numbers and using Chain Mode GCM are now mandatory. PhotonPeer.GcmDatagramEncryption as it is no longer optional. Note: An update of the Realtime API covers this change.
    Changed: The EnetPeer NCommandPool is now a Pool<NCommand>. This avoids having another pooling class, just for NCommands.
    Removed: NCommand.Release() which was returning the command to a pool.NCommands no longer refer to some pool they should return to.
    Changed: NCommand creation and initialization to fit using Pool<NCommand>. This is now done in a few separate steps.
    Changed: CommandQueue is now a ConcurrentQueue<NCommand> to avoid manual locking. The receive thread writes to it, others read.
    Changed: ReceiveIncomingCommands no longer executes ACKs immediately on the receive thread.
    Changed: Due to queueing ACKs, the CommandQueue must be executed in SendOutgoingCommands (to avoid resends due to not executed ACKs).
    Internal: Added NCommand.TimeOfReceive to track when a command came in. Keeps roundtrip time useful, even if with infrequent dispatch.

Version 5.0.6 (02. May 2024 - rev7543)
    Internal: Removed surplus optional code to debug command pooling.
    Internal: Simplified SendAcksOnly and SendOutgoingCommands. Removed duplication of code.
    Changed: SendAcksOnly() no longer counts via SendOutgoingCommandsCalled(). It no longer sets the Stats.LastSendOutgoingTimestamp.
    Changed: SendOutgoingCommands(bool) to set Stats.LastSendOutgoingTimestamp only if not using sendAcksOnly = true.
    Changed: datagramEncryptedConnection is now thread safe, using Interlocked. Added property for this: SendWindowUpdateRequired.
    Removed: Locks on the udpBuffer. Obsolete due to datagramEncryptedConnection becoming thread safe.
    Removed: SendOutgoingCommands() use of a "lock (this.udpBuffer)". The method is locked in the PhotonPeer and the buffer itself does not need additional locking.

Version 5.0.5 (29. April 2024 - rev7531)
    Changed: SendAcksOnly and SendOutgoingCommands will return true (which means "more to send") when any resends did not fit into the current datagram. This usually causes another call to send them in another datagram.
    Changed: Stats.UdpReliableCommandsResent is only increased, when the resent command actually fit into a datagram, which makes this value more precise.

Version 5.0.4 (19. April 2024 - rev7511)
    Changed: Sending of reliable commands. There is now a "Send Window" which limits how many reliable commands are being sent, based off the lowest sent sequence number, only the next XY sequence numbers can be sent. This moves with incoming acknowledgements. This avoids spamming the server, which caused resends.
    Note: Per channel, the Send Window indirectly affects unreliable and even unsequenced commands by ending the sending for a channel early. Use a separate channel (higher number) for larger chunks of data to avoid related lag.
    Renamed: PhotonPeer.SequenceDeltaLimitSends to SendWindowSize.
    Removed: PhotonPeer.SequenceDeltaLimitResends. If a reliable command needs re-sending, it is something the server is waiting for, so we just send.
    Changed: Stats.UdpReliableCommandsSent is increased only on the initial send of a command (excluding resends).
    Changed: Stats.UdpFragmentsIn is increased only for new/unique receives of fragments (excluding resends from remote).

Version 5.0.3 (25. March 2024 - rev7477)
    Changed: Statistics handling for the PhotonPeer and connections. Several values moved to the PhotonPeer.Stats (e.g. PeerBase.BytesIn, .BytesOut and PeerBase.timestampOfLastReceive).
    Removed: PhotonPeer.TrafficStatsEnabled. The stats are simplified and it should not be necessary to check a bool to avoid setting some.
    Removed: Separate instance for In and Out values.
    Removed: Traffic stats counting and handling in various internal places.
    Note: Simpler for UDP now, as it just counts the complete UDP payload as passed to ReceiveIncomingCommands(). This was scattered around.
    Changed: Use TrafficStats.ToSnapshot() to create a TrafficStatsSnapshot. This contains current values and the timestamp. TrafficStatsSnapshots can be compared to other snapshots and the current TrafficStats, providing you with a TrafficStatsDelta instance. This should be useful to get an idea of how things changed between both timestamps.
    Changed: All dispatch callbacks now make use of Stats.DurationOfLastDispatchCallback instead of having individual values.
    Changed: PhotonPeer.VitalStatsToString() to focus on important values and make them always available.
    Changed: WebSocket paths now include a peerID field and a client-generated "ID" (which is not entirely unique but doesn't have to be). Also, it adds "_" and the connection-count (prepareWebSocketUrlCount).
    Changed: WebSocket paths are built with a re-used StringBuilder and only ever contain the first 8 characters of an AppId (unless suppressed entirely).
    Changed: OperationResponse.ToString() includes the DebugMessage (unless empty).

Version 5.0.2 (01. February 2024 - rev7373)
    Changed: PhotonClientWebSocket will now set the SocketErrorCode to clientWebSocket.CloseStatus if the WebSocket fails to go into "open" state.
    Changed: Logging for this case to include a description (which might be empty).

Version 5.0.1 (07. December 2023 - rev7261)
    No notable changes.

Version 5.0.0 (09. November 2023 - rev7225)
    Changed: To semantic versioning with 3 digits only.
    Removed: Support for .Net 3.5. From 5.x on we use .Net Standard 2.0 as minimum.
    Changed: To a newer Unity version define (#if UNITY_2017_4_OR_NEWER).
    Changed: Handling of incorrect stream data.
    Breaking: DLLs for Unity will no longer use a custom Hashtable re-implementation. Remove all defines which Hashtable to use (using Hashtable = ExitGames.Client.Photon.Hashtable;).

    Merged changes of Version 4.1.6.24 (11. May 2023 - rev6888)
    Changed: PhotonClientWebSocket.Send() will now Wait up to 3ms for the Send-Task before it returns "busy". This allows the task to complete and the TPeer can send multiple messages until it send MTU bytes. That avoids increasing lag, if the game logic calls SendOutgoingCommands() sparingly.
    Changed: PeerBase.Reset() will now also clear the ActionQueue.
    Fixed: WebSocket connection issues where clients never get into a Connected state. This is a workaround for cases where a WebSocket bug skips the callback for the Init Response from the server. This is a rare issue which does not reproduce 100% of the time.
    Changed: WebSocket connections will now send pings in one second intervals as long as the WebSocket is connected (and the peerConnectionState is not Disconnected).
    Changed: If a ping result arrives while the peer is still Connecting, it is used as Init Response on WebSocket connections.
    Changed: TPeer.FetchServerTimestamp() to only log something (INFO level) if the peer is not connected and initialized yet. FetchServerTimestamp can be repeated and does not need a SendError callback.
    Changed: PhotonClientWebSocket.Disconnect() to call CloseAsync() if the WebSocket is already in state CloseReceived. This should just close the socket locally.

Version 4.1.8.4 (26. April 2024 - rev7530)
    Changed: SendAcksOnly and SendOutgoingCommands logging (they only log successful re-sends).
    Changed: In QueueSentCommand the reliableCommandsSent is increased only for commands that are sent the first time (not counting repeats anymore).

Version 4.1.8.3 (24. April 2024 - rev7519)
    Changed: Sending of reliable commands. There is now a "Send Window" which limits how many reliable commands are being sent, based off the lowest sent sequence number, only the next XY sequence numbers can be sent. This moves with incoming acknowledgements. This avoids spamming the server, which caused resends.
    Note: Per channel, the Send Window indirectly affects unreliable and even unsequenced commands by ending the sending for a channel early. Use a separate channel (higher number) for larger chunks of data to avoid related lag.
    Renamed: PhotonPeer.SequenceDeltaLimitSends to SendWindowSize.
    Removed: PhotonPeer.SequenceDeltaLimitResends. If a reliable command needs re-sending, it is something the server is waiting for, so we just send.
    Changed: Resending of commands (UDP). SendOutgoingCommands now makes sure to return true if any of the resends does not fit in the current datagram. Internally, the next check for resends is scheduled "immediately".

Version 4.1.8.2 (25. March 2024 - rev7471)
    Added: PhotonLibs\WebSocket\PhotonWebSocket.asmdef, which wraps up the code and dlls for WebGL exports. This is auto referenced.

Version 4.1.8.1 (12. March 2024 - rev7444)
    Fixed: SocketTcp which was reading the wrong TCP Header byte as "reliable" indicator. This meant, the TrafficStatsIncoming were wrong.

Version 4.1.8.0 (31. January 2024 - rev7364)
    No notable changes. The Realtime API has some breaking changes. Check that changelog.

Version 4.1.7.4 (13. December 2023 - rev7284)
    Fixed: PhotonPeer.BytesOut internal counting.

Version 4.1.7.3 (07. December 2023 - rev7252)
    No notable changes.

Version 4.1.7.2 (20. September 2023 - rev7218)
    Fixed: DisconnectTimeout is no longer capped. You can set any value client side. Server side timeouts can only be set for Self Hosted or Enterprise Server.

Version 4.1.7.1 (06. September 2023 - rev7148)
    Fixed: Internal state changes to report UDP based Client Timeouts to the server.

Version 4.1.7.0 (18. August 2023 - rev7111)
    Added: PhotonPeer.SocketErrorCode (int) to provide the low level error code (relevant when the connection gets lost).
    Changed: SocketUdp to report WouldBlock exceptions as "busy". The handling code could use this to not try send anything else in this loop.
    Added: Preserve attribute to SocketWebTcp constructor to keep Unity from stripping it from builds.

Version 4.1.6.26 (09. August 2023 - rev7076)
    Fixed: PhotonClientWebSocket.Send() waits up to 5ms after sending async to allow the message being written to the network layer.
    Fixed: PhotonClientWebSocket.Send() now provides a distinct return code if the WebSocket did not yet finish sending the data. In that case, the memory which was used for it, is not returned to the pooling. This can cause allocations but fixes cases where messages were modified after they were considered sent.
    Changed: PhotonClientWebSocket connecting to the server is cancelled after 7 second max (was: 5).
    Changed: PhotonClientWebSocket AsyncConnectAndReceive will log to the debug callback instead of using Console.Writeline().
    Changed: PhotonClientWebSocket error handling for readTask.Wait().

Version 4.1.6.25 (05. June 2023 - rev6925)
    Added: TPeer now measures longestSentCall in SendData().
    Changed: TPeer.SendOutgoingCommands() to return false if the socket is still busy (which means "no need to call send again in this loop).

Version 4.1.6.24 (15. May 2023 - rev6894)
    Changed: PhotonClientWebSocket.Send() will now Wait up to 3ms for the Send-Task before it returns "busy". This allows the task to complete and the TPeer can send multiple messages until it send MTU bytes. That avoids increasing lag, if the game logic calls SendOutgoingCommands() sparingly.
    Changed: PeerBase.Reset() will now also clear the ActionQueue.
    Fixed: WebSocket connection issues where clients never get into a Connected state. This is a workaround for cases where a WebSocket bug skips the callback for the Init Response from the server. This is a rare issue which does not reproduce 100% of the time.
    Changed: WebSocket connections will now send pings in one second intervals as long as the WebSocket is connected (and the peerConnectionState is not Disconnected).
    Changed: If a ping result arrives while the peer is still Connecting, it is used as Init Response on WebSocket connections.
    Changed: TPeer.FetchServerTimestamp() to only log something (INFO level) if the peer is not connected and initialized yet. FetchServerTimestamp can be repeated and does not need a SendError callback.
    Changed: PhotonClientWebSocket.Disconnect() to call CloseAsync() if the WebSocket is already in state CloseReceived. This should just close the socket locally.

Version 4.1.6.23 (15. March 2023 - rev6743)
    Fixed: Handling of unknown command types in Initialize(EnetPeer peer, byte[] inBuff, ref int readingOffset). Reading offset is set by Size value.
    Fixed: ReadCustomType() and ReadCustomTypeArray() to check if DeserializeStreamFunction is null, before using it. There was a check which prevented issues but it wasn't correct.
