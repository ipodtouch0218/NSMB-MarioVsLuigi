            Now, instead, it inherits from NetworkAreaOfInterestBehaviour, so we need to have a PositionWordOffset
            and leave space for a position field, even though it does not use it.
            It is possible for inheritors of this class (like NetworkTransform) to have a "negative" initial offset
            and overlap with this position field.
