### Build 497 (May 31, 2022)

**What's New**

- ILWeaver: support for Wrapping/Unwrapping without a `NetworkRunner`. There are three constructs Fusion supports:  
```  
    public struct Wrapper : INetworkStruct {  
       ...  
    }  
    public class WrappedByValue {  
      [NetworkSerializeMethod]   public static Wrapper Wrap(WrappedByValue obj) { ... };  
      [NetworkDeserializeMethod] public static WrappedByValue Unwrap(Wrapper wrapper) { ... }  
    }  
    public class WrappedByRef {  
      [NetworkSerializeMethod]   public static Wrapper Wrap(WrappedByRef obj) { ... }  
      [NetworkDeserializeMethod] public static void Unwrap(Wrapper wrapper, ref WrappedByRef result) { ... }  
    }  
    // both methods return number of bytes read/written  
    public class WrappedRaw {  
      [NetworkSerializeMethod(MaxSize = ...)] public static int Wrap(WrappedRaw obj, byte* data) { ... }  
      [NetworkDeserializeMethod] public static int Unwrap(byte* data, ref WrappedRaw result) { ... }  
    }  
```  
Such wrapped types (`WrappedByValue`, `WrappedByRef` and `WrappedRaw`) can be used in any `[Networked]` property (both in structs and `NetworkBehaviours`) and RPC

**Improvements**

- ILWeaver: multiple invalid constructs are now detected during weaving time and reported as errors

**Removed**

- NetworkRunner.NotifyEditorPlayModeExit (no longer needed)

### Build 484 (May 25, 2022)

**Changes**

- `NetworkRunner.RegisterUniqueObjects` throws `InvalidOperationException` if an object has already been attached to
- Logging an error due to scene object being missed moved to `NetworkSceneManagerBase`
- If a remote object fails to be attached (missing prefab, missing scene object), another attempt will be made next frame, until it is either successful or the object got removed from the simulation. No errors are emit. This allows for a more flexible scene loading scenarios
- If making a Standalone build, a warning is emit if `PlayerSettings.runInBackground` is not enabled

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: Inactive Prefabs/scene objects not having their state objects released on being destroyed
- Fixed: Not being able to load and unload a scene repeatedly on a client

**Breaking Changes**

- RPC local invokes for host (in Host mode) have `RpcInfo.Source` set to `PlayerRef.None` (used to be: Host's local `PlayerRef`). If you want the old behavior back RPC, use `[Rpc(HostMode = RpcHostMode.SourceIsHostPlayer)]`. Note that in such case clients will also see host's player in `RpcInfo.Source`

**What's New**

- Unity-side logger implementation - FusionUnityLogger

- [ScriptHelp(BackColor = EditorHeaderBackColor.None)] attribute can be added to custom Fusion scripts do disable the inspector Fusion header graphics, and revert to the normal Script field

**Changes**

- `RpcInfo.Source` value for host is now controlled with `Rpc.HostMode`. When the host calls RPC, `[Rpc(HostMode = RpcHostMode.SourceIsServer)]` results with `RpcInfo.Source` being none and `[Rpc(HostMode = RpcHostMode.SourceIsHostPlayer)]` results with `RpcInfo.Source` being equal to the host's local player

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: `RpcInfo.Source` inconsistency for when RPC is invoked by the host. Was: local player for local invoke, none for remote clients. Is: none for local invoke and remote clients by default, can be changed with `Rpc.HostMode`

 Behaviours that change the Transform state of the predict-spawned object should either be ordered before NT or call `PredictedSpawnCacheTransformState` after doing so

### Build 426 (Feb 28, 2022)

**Changes**

- Objects are despawned when a runner is shutdown

### Build 424 (Feb 25, 2022)

- `NetworkRunner.GetInterfaceListHead(Type, int)` made obsolete, use `NetworkRunner.GetInterfaceListHead(Type, int, out SimulationBehaviour)` instead

**Removed**

- `Behaviour.IsEnabled`

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: NanoSockets for Intel Macs
- Fixed: Issues with packet corruption when client sending too large inputs or server sending to much state in eventual consistency mode

### Build 423 (Feb 24, 2022)

**What's New**

- Support DisableSessionCreation in SharedMode
- Reworked transform behaviours: `NetworkTransform`, `NetworkRigidbody` and `NetworkCharacterController`.
    This build brings an important rework to all core transform behaviours. Here is a summary of why we needed those modifications, what to expect and the most important changes.
	
	**Why:**
    - The previously available behaviours (NT/NRB/NCC) aimed to solve a very broad range of problems and scenarios, which led to a complex and hard to maintain codebase that sometimes misbehaved on core use-cases.  
    - While possible, user extension of these default functionalities and options provided by those behaviours was not easy. This prevented users from customizing them to their needs, often relying on modifications of the core implementation.  
    - NCC was unstable even when steering over simple scene colliders. The release of the new advanced KCC package further reduced its value even as a prototyping tool.  
    
	**What to expect:**  
    - New behaviours are easier to configure and are expected to be more stable in most common use-cases.  
    - They are also easier to extend and adjust for game specific needs. A new prototype component exemplifies exactly that (more below).  
    
	**Important changes:**  
    - All previously existing core transform behaviours are marked as obsolete and renamed, but were kept in the core libraries. Although their usage is no longer encouraged and provided support for them will be limited, they are still available if you want to upgrade but need more time to switch to the new behaviours.  
    - All new behaviours have the same name as the previous ones (e.g. `NetworkTransform`), except for `NetworkCharacterController` and `NetworkTransformAnchor`, which don't have a counterpart on new behaviours. To make this possible, old behaviours were renamed and have Obsolete added at the end of the class name: e.g. old `NetworkRigidbody` will be available as `NetworkRigidbodyObsolete` (the class is also marked as obsolete). Keeping the same name on the new behaviours also means that your existing prefabs and scene objects will automatically upgrade to use the new ones.  
    - There is no longer a core NCC behaviour (existing one is kept, but marked as obsolete). Instead, a new `NetworkCharacterControllerPrototype` is provided in source code on the SDK: it uses Unity's Character Controller and exemplifies how the base `NetworkTransform` behaviour can be extended. With this new prototype behaviour we aim to provide a simple, yet stable prototyping tool, while the KCC package remains the recommended one for production and more complex use-cases.  
    - Transform data is now always synchronized in world space. This is important to ensure Area of Interest (AOI) management works as expected. However, a configurable Interpolation Space will be available for all transform behaviours, so that the view (interpolation target) can be interpolated as if the networked data is in local space, allowing nested transforms to visually behave as expected. Interpolated prediction error correction is still always performed in world space and more complex hierarchies might require thoughtful control of the interpolation source, space and targets' hierarchies.  
    - There is no synchronization of neither scale nor parenting/hierarchy on the transform behaviours. If you need to synchronize these types of data/relations, the suggested approach is to extend the core behaviours, synchronizing scale in local space and controlling a decoupled hierarchy of the interpolation targets.  
    - Performing non-interpolated teleports no longer requires pre-steps. Optional interpolation velocities can be provided in order to smooth the transition. Check the new teleport API documentation for more details

**Improvements**

- Networked transform behaviours now have prediction error computed based on both From and To states used for rendering, instead of only on the latter

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: Issue with area of interest calculations when no compression was used for position
- Fixed: Detection of rotation prediction error on NetworkTransform and derived behaviours

### Build 419 (Feb 22, 2022)

**What's New**

- `NetworkProjectConfig.NullChecksForNetworkedProperties`

**Changes**

- RpcInvokeInfo reworked
- Weaver: Rpcs always check if `NetworkObject` has been attached to (used to be: only with debug DLLs)
- Weaver: `[Networked]` properties check if `NetworkObject` has been attached to if `NetworkProjectConfig.NullChecksForNetworkedProperties` is set (used to be: only with debug DLLs)

- `NetworkObject` script execution order to 500. `NetworkBehaviours` should have lower execution order to ensure consistent behaviour when activating initially deactivated `NetworkObjects`

**Removed**

- [ExecuteInEditMode] removed from NetworkObject - no longer needed

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: Issue with unity infinite loop/freeze when adding an simulation behaviour that was already in the update loop
- Fixed: Issue with AOI when Position accuracy compression is set to not compress
- Fixed: `Spawned` being called before `Awake` for initially deactivated objects. This only works if `NetworkBehaviour` subclasses have execution order (0 by default) lower than `NetworkObject` (500 by default). If this is not the case, a warning will be emit while baking scene/prefab with disabled objects containing such scripts
- Fixed: Issue with large initial delta snapshots causing crash

### Build 413 (Feb 15, 2022)

**Bug Fixes**

- `NetworkBehaviours` on deactivated GameObjects no longer have their callbacks invoked
- `NetworkObjects` that are initially deactivated are no longer activated by Fusion. However, `NetworkBehaviours` on such objects still have `CopyBackingFieldsToState` (for server) and `Spawned` invoked
- `Fusion.Behaviour.IsEnabled` now returns `MonoBehaviour.isActiveOrEnabled` (was: `MonoBehaviour.enabled`)

### Build 399 (Jan 28, 2022)

**What's New**

- `[NetworkPrefab]` attribute. When added to a `NetworkObject` field, the object picker will only show prefabs with `FusionPrefab` label.  
Remove: `NetworkProjectConfig.PrefabSources`: prefab source information is now stored in config's hidden nested assets and is generated based on prefabs marked with `FusionPrefab` label. This means that serialized config is now a lot smaller as it does not contain prefab information directly

**Changes**

- Prefabs with `NetworkObject` script are now labeled with `FusionPrefab` label during import
- `NetworkPrefabRef` property drawer: object picker shows prefabs with `FusionPrefab` label
- Config's initial `PrefabAssetsContainerPath` value to an empty string. This means that `NetworkPrefabAsset` (a reference-based alternative to `NetworkPrefabRef`/`NetworkObject` references) generation is now disabled by default. Existing configs are not affected
- `NetworkPrefabTable.TryAdd` now accepts a guid and an `INetworkPrefabSource` instance. If prefabs need to be added at runtime, `NetworkPrefabSourceStatic` and `NetworkPrefabSourceUnityBase` subclasses can be used as `INetworkPrefabSource` implementations
- NetworkPrefabAssets are disabled by default (they need `PrefabAssetsContainerPath` field set in `NetworkProjectConfig` inspector)

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: Config warning for initial weaving

### Build 296 (Sep 22, 2021)

**Changes**

- `LagCompensatedHit.Object` is deprecated and renamed to `GameObject`, now also having a more descriptive documentation

### Build 290 (Sep 13, 2021)

**What's New**

- [NetworkSerializeMethod] and [NetworkDeserializeMethod] attributes. Together they can make any type Fusion-serializable (usable in `[Networked]` properties and in Rpcs). Expected signatures, for type T, are `[NetworkSerializeMethod(MaxSize = <MaxByteSize>)] public static int <MethodName>(NetworkRunner runner, T obj, byte* data)` (returns number of bytes written) and `[NetworkDeserializeMethod] public static int <MethodName>(NetworkRunner, byte* data, ref T result)` (returns number of bytes read). There's also an alternative signature supported, which "wraps" T with an existing `INetworkStruct` type (S): `[NetworkSerializeMethod] public static S <MethodName>(NetworkRunner runner, T obj)` and `[NetworkDeserializeMethod] public static T <MethodName>(NetworkRunner runner, S wrapper)` or `[NetworkDeserializeMethod] public static void <MethodName>(NetworkRunner runner, S wrapper, ref T result)`

As a result the weaver is now an order of magnitude faster and more reliable. Also, weaving errors are now treated as compile errors (can't be accidentally cleared with the Clear button). If NetworkProjectConfig is not stored in its default location, implement ILWeaverSettings.OverrideNetworkProjectConfigPath in Fusion.CodeGen.User.cs

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed: NetworkTransformAnchor treats a null parent and a parent which is the MultiPeer root scene object both as null. Fixes teleport hitch when reparenting an object which has the MultiPeer root as its parent the first time
