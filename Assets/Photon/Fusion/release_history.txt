# 2.0.0

For a more in-depth overview over what changed check: [Coming from Fusion 1.0](https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/v2/getting-started/migration/coming-from-fusion-v1)

**Breaking Changes**

- Renamed addressable define from FUSION_USE_ADDRESSABLES -> FUSION_ENABLE_ADDRESSABLES
- `NetworkRunner.Spawn` method family now uses `NetworkSpawnFlags` parameter instead of bool flags
- PlayerRef / SceneRef no longer directly cast to/from int
- `INetworkkObjectPool` is now `INetworkObjectProvdier` and changed parameters of acquire and release functions
- `NetworkRunner.AddSimulationBehaviour` is now internal
- Removed ability for `SimulationBehaviours` to exist on networked objects, only `NetworkBehaviours` are used on `NetworkObjects` now.
- `(int)PlayerRef` -> `PlayerRef.PlayerId` and `PlayerRef.IsValid` -> `PlayerRef.IsRealPlayer`
- `(int)SceneRef` -> `SceneRef.FromIndex`
- `NetworkObject.Guid` -> `NetworkObject.NetworkTypeId`
- `Runner.Simulation.X` APIs now under `Runner.X`
- `INetworkSceneManager` interface API changed. `Runner.SetActiveScene` -> `Runner.LoadScene`

**What's New**

- `ChangeDector` that allows to detect changes for `NetworkProperties` in `Render`, `FUN` or at custom intervals.
- `PropertyReaders` and `TryGetSnapshotBuffers`, to allow for custom interpolation and previous networked property state.
- `NetworkBehaviourBufferInterpolator` for simplified interpolation for built-in types and custom registered types.
- LagCompensation support for 2D physics.
- Server/Client Simulation/Send/ rates can now be adjusted individually in host/server mode. Fixed to 20 for shared mode.
- StartGameArgs.UseDefaultPhotonCloudPorts
- NetworkSceneManager now supports loading addressable scenes.
- NetworkSceneManager now supports additive loading of scenes.
- Added Last Received Tick on the network object runtime debug info
- `NetworkSceneManagerDefault.GetMultiplePeerTargetScene` - ability to override the logic of choosing a root scene object in MP mode
- `NetworkProjectConfig.EnqueueIncompleteSynchronousSpawns` - if enabled, synchronous incomplete spawns (Addressables etc.) get enqueued instead of throwing an exception
- `NetworkObjectAcquireResult.Ignore` - if object provider returns this, Fusion will no longer try to acquire an instance for a state object
- `SceneRef.FromPath` - creates a scene ref based on a hash of a path. Useful for easily creating `SceneRefs` of Addressable scenes
- `NetworkPrefabId` constructor removed, use `FromIndex` or `FromRaw` instead
- AOI `INetworkRunnerCallbacks` for when objects enter and exit AOI. `OnObjectEnterAOI`, `OnObjectExitAOI`

**Changes**

- Shared mode ticks are now aligned between clients.
- `NetworkPhysics` are now provided via a separate addon that comes as part of the Fusion package.
- Hitbox buffer size in NetworkProjectConfig is now in milliseconds instead of ticks.
- `NetworkSceneManagerDefault` works with Addressables 1.19.x, but will throw at an attempt of loading an addressable scene with local physics mode
- SimilationBehaviours are now found on children of Runner. Disabled behaviours are ignored
- INetworkRunnerCallbacks can be found on children of Runner
- BehaviourMeta in `NetworkProjectConfig` gets refreshed whenever relevant script's execution order change
- RPCs in Shared mode are no longer treated as if they were always declared with `TickAligned=false`
- `Render` is now invoked right after `MonoBehaviour.Update` (previously: before `MonoBehaviour.LateUpdate`)
- `RpcAttribute.InvokeResim` is now deprecated and no longer used
- Updated Photon Realtime SDK to v4.1.6.23
- `NetworkSceneManagerDefault`: if no scenes are loaded in MP mode, an inactive limbo root will be created to host any new objects. Once a "real" scene has been loaded, objects are going to be evicted from the limbo
- JoinSessionLobby to include `useDefaultCloudPorts` argument
- `InitializeNetworkObjectAssignRunner` needlessly made NBs owned twice
- Completely removed predictive spawns
- `SimulationBehaviours` are no longer Unity-null and `isActiveAndEnabled` checked when invoking callbacks. Flags set in OnEnable/OnDisable/OnDestroy are used instead. User code does not need any patching, any flag setting is handled by the weaver
- `NetworkConditions` fields are hidden unless it is enabled
- Look of inline help and script header is now driven by `FusionEditorSkin.guiskin`
- Renamed `CastEnumAttribute` to `DisplayAsEnumAttribute`; it also handles long/ulong fields now
- `DrawIf/WarnIfAttributes` can point to methods/properties, as long as they're top-level
- `INetworkSceneManager.OnSceneInfoChanged` is now always invoked right before `IBeforeTick`
- `NetworkSceneManagerDefault` reports itself busy until first `OnSceneInfoChanged` arrives
- `NetworkSceneManagerDefault` will move a spawned object to DontDestroyOnLoad in Multiple Peer mode if there are no scenes loaded for a runner. A warning explaining what happened will be emit as well
- `NetworkObjectProviderDefault` no longer fails for synchronous acquires that fail to return an instance immediately
- Simplified `NetworkSceneMangerDefault` - always uses dynamic addressable scenes list (finds scenes under a given label)

**Removed**

- Removed `InterpolationTarget` from `NetworkTransform`. The object with the `NetworkTransform` is now interpolated directly.
- Removed `[Accuracy]` and `[AccuracyRange]` range attributes. Accuracy is no longer supported
- Remove `PlayerRefSet` from `RpcInvokeInfo`. Since PlayerRef is no longer a linear index, fixed-size collection is not possible.
- Removed `[OrderBefore]` and `[OrderAfter]`. Use Unity execution order instead.
- Removed predicted Spawning and spawn keys. Predicted spawning is no longer supported.
- Removed Delta Snapshots state transfer mode.

- Fixed: `SceneRef.ToString` throwing for path hashes
- Fixed: Scene info not being read properly by `Simulation.GetSceneInfo`
- Fixed: `INetworkSceneManager.OnSceneChanged` being called repeatedly for clients
- Fixed: Prefab order being locale-dependent
